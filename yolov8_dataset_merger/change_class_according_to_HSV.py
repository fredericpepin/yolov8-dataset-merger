Module Summary
==============

Module meant to change fruit class based on the color of the detected 
fruit.

Motivation: some datasets only identify tomatoes as such, without dif-
ferentiating between ripe and unripe fruits. This is true for a spe-
cial case, the TomatoOcclusion dataset, which addresses the problematic
of occlusion of fruits by branches, leaves and other fruits, or a mix 
of all the latters. 

In order to be compatible with other quality datasets (like TomatoLaboro)
the need arises to characterize the ripeness of Tomatoes. 


Based on the bounding box geometry and position, detect the presence of
color spectrum (red) in a square box around center point of a bounding 
box (red is ripe). An enhanced approach would be to sample more regions
in the bounding box, as it could be that a branch / leaf is present at 
middle point. But this also leads to the problem of a false detection
of red of a ripe tomato behind an unripe one. Detection of partially
hidden unripe tomatoes will also lead to problems if a red tomato 
overlaps the center of the former. Thus, the detection of occluded 
unripe tomato should be in my opinion left out. It is also less critical
then the detection of ripe tomatoes in the bigger picture.
Another stance could also be, falsely characterizing a unripe tomato 
is not critical, because unripe tomatoes continue to ripe also after
harvest anyway. Therefore, the marginal phenomenon of characterizing 
an occluded unripe tomato as ripe because a red tomato overlaps 
ther region of interest at mid point doesn't have big repercussions and
is likely to rarely happen in a given dataset.

FunctÃ­on Summary
================

Determines if a tomato within a bounding box in the image is ripe 
by evaluating the color within the bounding box in the HSV 
color space. The image is sampled around the center of the bounding 
box, and the HSV values of the region are analyzed to check for the 
presence of red, indicating ripeness.

The function takes normalized coordinates for the center of the 
bounding box and normalized box dimensions, converts them to pixel 
coordinates, and samples a region around the center. The region is 
converted to the HSV color space, and the ripeness is checked by 
determining if any pixels fall within the red color range.

This function processes images of subdirectories "train, test, valid"

(ROI) around each bounding box's center point. 
It updates the class IDs in the label files based on the ripeness

The function reads all images and their corresponding label files 
in the specified directory, checks the ripeness of the tomatoes
